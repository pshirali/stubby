Stubby is a (short and thick) HTTP stub server.
Refer to the README for more info.

This application utilizes Aglyph Dependency Injection framework,
and is meant to serve as a beginner's tutorial on how DI could be
used in Python. This application is not part of the official
documentation for Aglyph, nor does it cover all features that
Aglyph has to offer.

    # and prints a traceback. By explicitly assembling `st-config`, we
    # allow for SystemExit to not break the assembly of a class which
    # depended on it. Also, `st-config` is a singleton, and the parsed
    # args are cached for subsequent retrieval.
